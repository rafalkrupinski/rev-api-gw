Reverse API Gateway
======

Currently works  only with etsy.com -  has hardcoded addresses and supports only non-expiring OAuth 1.0 token.

Key, token and secrets are passed as parameters

The idea for this projest is that it should accept configuration and key/token/secrets updates using simple RESTful API or via KV store.
